I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University. I am advised by Professor Stavros Kalafatis in the Robotics, AR, and VR Research group. My recent work has focused on building robust architectures for modular multi-robot systems in disadvantageous network environments. My research broadly lies in harnessing the potential of edge devices to enhance resource utilization.

Prior to joining Texas A&M, I completed my Bachelors' from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, with a major in Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering (Honors). Throughout my tenure at IIT, I collaborated closely with two esteemed professors. With Professor Pradip Mandal, I focused on testing a Cross Coupled Switched Capacitor based DC-DC Boost Converter. Additionally, I worked alongside Professor Mrigank Sharad on designing System-on-Chip (SoC) controllers for miniature low-power robots.
