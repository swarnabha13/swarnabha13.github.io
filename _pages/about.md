I am a sixth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/index.html) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html). I am advised by Professor [Stavros Kalafatis](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/profiles/kalafatis-stavros.html) in the [Robotics, AR, and VR Research group](https://pxar.engr.tamu.edu/people/). My recent work has focused on building robust architectures for modular multi-robot systems in disadvantageous network environments. My research broadly lies in harnessing the potential of edge devices to enhance resource utilization.

Prior to joining Texas A&M, I completed my Bachelors' from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), with a major in Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering (Honors). Throughout my tenure at IIT, I collaborated closely with two esteemed professors. With Professor [Pradip Mandal](http://www.ecdept.iitkgp.ac.in/Eece/facultydetails/ece-pradip), I focused on testing a Cross Coupled Switched Capacitor based DC-DC Boost Converter. Additionally, I worked alongside Professor [Mrigank Sharad](http://www.see.iitkgp.ac.in/team-view/dr-mrigank-sharad/) on designing System-on-Chip (SoC) controllers for miniature low-power robots.
